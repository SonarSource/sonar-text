      message: Make sure that disclosing this AWS secret is safe here.
      fix: >
          The affected secret should be revoked. A new one should be generated
          following the official AWS documentation. Moreover, recent accesses to
          the AWS API should be reviewed to make sure no malicious use was
          performed.
