== What is the potential impact?

Fortunately, in the case of storage account secrets, Azure provides the ability to
set
short expiration policies.

Once the malicious user has the storage account key, they may be able to
authenticate and access Azure resources on behalf of the compromised account or
user. These are similar to the root password, allowing full access to Azure
Storage Accounts.

From this point, the impact of this security issue depends on how well the
organization's Azure ecosystem was protected and how strongly the principle of
least privilege was applied to the affected account.

==== Data Theft

The malicious users now have the ability to steal various types of data stored
in Azure services, such as customer information, intellectual property, financial
data, or other sensitive data.

This vulnerability affects a number of Azure services, including:

* Storage containers
* Azure SQL databases
* Code repositories or version control systems, which can expose proprietary code and sensitive algorithms
* Azure Key Vaults, when the user has access to other secrets that are supposed to be hidden
* Backups

==== Termination of service

With compromised credentials, an attacker can terminate various types of
services, resulting in the loss of virtual servers, clusters and all data
stored on them.

For example:

* Virtual Machines and load balancers
* Azure SQL Databases
* Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) clusters, container instances and registries
* Azure serverless "Functions"

==== Malicious exploitation on a large scale

With the goal of either undermining the organization's reputation or profiting
from newly acquired computing capabilities, malicious users can also perform a
variety of actions that are not always publicized in the mainstream media.

Such examples include

* Mining cryptocurrencies by exploiting the computing resources of compromised instances or containers for their own profit.
* Malware distribution and remote control by building a network of compromised instances or containers to form a botnet that can be used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, malware distribution, or other malicious activities
* Phishing or spoofing architectures. From the victim's perspective, the attack originates from the victim's organization rather than a malicious organization
