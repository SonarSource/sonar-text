=== What are the possible effects?

Fortunately, in the case of secret access keys and key IDs, AWS has taken care
to ensure that the system only grants access if two different strings are
specified.

However, keeping both of them secret is important. If an attacker gets hold of a leaked secret access key, they can try to guess
or deduce the associated access key ID or use other methods to find it. In the
worst case, the access key ID is stored right next to the secret key.

Once the malicious user has both the ID access key and the secret access key,
They may be able to authenticate and access AWS resources on behalf of the
compromised account or user.

From this point, the impact of this security issue depends on how well the AWS
organization was protected and how strongly the principle of least privilege
was applied to the affected IAM account.
