=== What is the potential impact?

Fortunately, in the case of session secrets, IBM provides the ability to set
short token lifetimes.

However, once in possession of the secret session key, the malicious user may
be able to authenticate and access IBM resources on behalf of the compromised
account or user.

From this point, the impact of this security issue depends on how well the IBM 
Cloud organization was protected and how strongly the principle of least
privilege was applied to the affected IAM account.

==== Data Theft

Malicious users now have the ability to steal various types of data stored
in IBM Cloud, such as customer information, intellectual property, financial
data, or other sensitive data.

This vulnerability affects a number of IBM services, including:

* Object Storage
* IBM Db2 Databases
* Code repositories or version control systems, which can expose proprietary code and sensitive algorithms
* IBM Key Protect, when the user has access to other secrets that are supposed to be hidden
* Backups

==== Termination of service

With compromised credentials, an attacker can terminate various types of
services, resulting in the loss of virtual servers, clusters and all data
stored on them.

For example:

* Virtual Servers
* Db2 databases
* IBM Kubernetes Services (IKS) clusters
* IBM Cloud Functions

==== Malicious exploitation on a large scale

With the goal of either undermining the organization's reputation or profiting
from newly acquired computing capabilities, malicious users can also perform a
variety of actions that are not always publicized in the mainstream media.

Such examples include

* Mining cryptocurrencies by exploiting the computing resources of compromised instances or containers for their own profit.
* Malware distribution and remote control by building a network of compromised instances or containers to form a botnet that can be used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, malware distribution, or other malicious activities
* Phishing or spoofing architectures. From the victim's perspective, the attack originates from the victim's organization rather than a malicious organization
