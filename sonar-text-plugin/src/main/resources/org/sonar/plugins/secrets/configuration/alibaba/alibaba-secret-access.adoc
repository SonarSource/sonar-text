=== What is the potential impact?

Fortunately, in the case of secret access keys and key IDs, Alibaba has taken
care to ensure that the system only grants access if two different strings are
specified.

If an attacker gets hold of a leaked access key secret, they can try to guess
or deduce the associated access key ID or use other methods to find it. In the
worst case, the access key ID is stored right next to the secret key.

Once the malicious user has both the ID access key and the secret access key,
he may be able to authenticate and access Alibaba resources on behalf of the
compromised account or user.

From this point, the impact of this security issue depends on how well the
Alibaba organization was protected and how strongly the principle of least
privilege was applied to the affected IAM account.

==== Data Theft

The malicious users now have the ability to steal various types of data stored
in Alibaba services, such as customer information, intellectual property,
financial data, or other sensitive data.

This vulnerability affects a number of Alibaba services, including:

* Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets
* ApsaraDB RDS databases
* Code repositories or version control systems, which can expose proprietary code and sensitive algorithms
* Key Management Service (KMS), when the user has access to other secrets that are supposed to be hidden
* Backups

==== Termination of service

With compromised credentials, an attacker can terminate various types of
services, resulting in the loss of virtual servers, clusters and all data
stored on them.

For example:

* Elastic Compute Service (ECS) and load balancers
* ApsaraDB RDS instances
* Alibaba Kubernetes (ACK) clusters and container registries

==== Malicious exploitation on a large scale

With the goal of either undermining the organization's reputation or profiting
from newly acquired computing capabilities, malicious users can also perform a
variety of actions that are not always publicized in the mainstream media.

Such examples include

* Mining cryptocurrencies by exploiting the computing resources of compromised instances or containers for their own profit.
* Malware distribution and remote control by building a network of compromised instances or containers to form a botnet that can be used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, malware distribution, or other malicious activities
*
