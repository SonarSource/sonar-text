== What is the potential impact?

Once in possession of the Google API key, the malicious user may be able to
authenticate and access Google resources on behalf of the compromised account
or user.

From this point on, the impact of this security issue depends on how well the
company's Google ecosystem has been protected and how strongly the principle of
least privilege has been applied to the affected account.

==== Data theft

The malicious users now have the ability to steal various types of data stored
in Google services, such as customer information, intellectual property,
financial data or other sensitive data.

This vulnerability affects a number of Google services, such as:

* Google Drive
* Google Calendar
* Google Analytics
* Google Cloud Storage

==== Financial implications and non-compliance

Depending on the permissions granted for the token, there is a financial impact
as your organization will be charged for the data consumed by the malicious
actor.

If your account has a quota enabled to limit your app's API consumption, that
quota may be exceeded, leaving your app unable to request the Google APIs it
needs to function properly.

If abused, the malicious user could also provoke downtime, which Google could
trigger in response to an excessive number of API requests. This could impact
business operations, lead to lost revenue, and potentially damage your
customers' trust and reputation.

Last but not least, depending on your industry and the type of data involved, a
leak of sensitive information via a Google Cloud API could lead to
non-compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) or industry-specific regulations. +
This can lead to legal consequences, fines, and additional financial burdens
associated with compliance efforts and litigation.
