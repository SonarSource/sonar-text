<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source
code is intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get
exposed to an unintended audience.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don’t need to know the secret might get access to it. They might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated
services or resources.</p>
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people’s role and entitlement.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>In the case of Discord, a webhook URL allows access to a channel and the consequences depend on what is specified in the <code>Bot
Permissions</code>.</p>
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.</p>
<h4>Identity spoofing</h4>
<p>Using the webhook URL, attackers can impersonate you or your bot, send messages on your behalf or perform other actions that could disrupt the
integrity of your server.</p>
<h4>Phishing</h4>
<p>An attacker can use this webhook to offer users links to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. From here, an attacker can intercept the
user’s credentials, bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), and take over the user’s account on the trusted site.</p>
<h4>Malware distribution</h4>
<p>In addition, malware can be stored and distributed, both to Discord users and other potential targets, as Discord is often used for storage.<br> It
is important to note that this leak can lead to full system compromises in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the
secret is revoked.</p>
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This will ensure the secret’s security and prevent any further unexpected
disclosure.</p>
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.</p>
