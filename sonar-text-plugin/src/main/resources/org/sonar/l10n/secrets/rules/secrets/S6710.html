<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source
code is intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get
exposed to an unintended audience.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don’t need to know the secret might get access to it. They might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated
services or resources.</p>
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people’s role and entitlement.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>A FCM API key leak is particularly severe if the affected key has administrative privileges: The range of topics to which an attacker can subscribe
and send messages is much larger than with normal privileges.</p>
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the secret.</p>
<h4>Phishing and spam</h4>
<p>An attacker can use this {secret_type} to spam users or lure them into links to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker.</p>
<p>Spam can cause users to be exposed to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Unsolicited, inappropriate content, such as pornographic material </li>
  <li> Fraudulent attempts to trick users into sending information or money </li>
  <li> Abusive or hateful statements </li>
  <li> False advertising or fraudulent claims </li>
</ul>
<p>Once a user has been phished on a legitimate-seeming third-party website, an attacker can collect the user’s credentials, bypass multi-factor
authentication (MFA), and take over the user’s account on the trusted website.</p>
<h4>Malware distribution</h4>
<p>In addition, malware can be stored and distributed, both to users of the service and other potential targets.<br> It is important to note that this
leak can lead to full system compromises in the worst-case scenario.</p>
<h4>Chaining of vulnerabilities</h4>
<p>Triggering arbitrary workflows can lead to problems ranging from a denial of service to worse, depending on how the webhook’s data is handled. If
the webhook performs a specific action that is affected by a vulnerability, the webhook acts as a remote attack vector on the enterprise.</p>
<p>Components affected by this webhook could, for example, experience unexpected failures or excessive resource consumption. If it is a single point
of failure (SPOF), this leak is critical.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the
secret is revoked.</p>
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This will ensure the secret’s security and prevent any further unexpected
disclosure.</p>
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.</p>
