<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source
code is intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get
exposed to an unintended audience.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don’t need to know the secret might get access to it. They might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated
services or resources.</p>
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people’s role and entitlement.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Telegram bot keys are used to authenticate and authorize a bot to interact with the Telegram Bot API. These keys are essentially access tokens that
allow the bot to send and receive messages, manage groups and channels, and perform other actions on behalf of the bot.</p>
<p>If a Telegram bot key is accidentally exposed to an unintended audience, the primary concern is that unauthorized individuals may gain access to
the bot’s functionalities and data. This could result in misuse or abuse of the bot’s capabilities. For instance, unauthorized users could send
unsolicited messages, spam users, or engage in other disruptive activities using the bot.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the
secret is revoked.</p>
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This will ensure the secret’s security and prevent any further unexpected
disclosure.</p>
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.</p>
