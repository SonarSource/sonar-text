<p>Secret leaks often occur when a sensitive piece of authentication data is stored with the source code of an application. Considering the source
code is intended to be deployed across multiple assets, including source code repositories or application hosting servers, the secrets might get
exposed to an unintended audience.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>In most cases, trust boundaries are violated when a secret is exposed in a source code repository or an uncontrolled deployment environment.
Unintended people who don’t need to know the secret might get access to it. They might then be able to use it to gain unwanted access to associated
services or resources.</p>
<p>The trust issue can be more or less severe depending on the people’s role and entitlement.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>A Facebook application secret key is a unique authentication token assigned to a Facebook application. It is used to authenticate and authorize the
application to access Facebook’s APIs and services. This key is required to perform actions on Facebook API, such as retrieving user data, posting on
behalf of users, or accessing various Facebook features.</p>
<p>If a Facebook application secret key leaks to an unintended audience, it can have serious security-related consequences both for the associated
Facebook application and its users. Especially, attackers knowing an application’s secret key will be able to access users' data that the application
has been granted access to.</p>
<p>This can represent a severe confidentiality loss for Personally Identifiable Information. This might be against national regulatory requirements in
some countries.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p><strong>Revoke the secret</strong></p>
<p>Revoke any leaked secrets and remove them from the application source code.</p>
<p>Before revoking the secret, ensure that no other applications or processes is using it. Other usages of the secret will also be impacted when the
secret is revoked.</p>
<p><strong>Use a secret vault</strong></p>
<p>A secret vault should be used to generate and store the new secret. This will ensure the secret’s security and prevent any further unexpected
disclosure.</p>
<p>Depending on the development platform and the leaked secret type, multiple solutions are currently available.</p>
