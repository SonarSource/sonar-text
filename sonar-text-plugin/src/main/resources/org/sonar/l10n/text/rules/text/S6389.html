<p>Using bidirectional (BIDI) characters can lead to incomprehensible code.</p>
<p>The Unicode encoding contains BIDI control characters that are used to display text right-to-left (RTL) instead of left-to-right (LTR). This is
necessary for certain languages that use RTL text. The BIDI characters can be used to create a difference in the code between what a human sees and
what a compiler or interpreter sees. An advisary might use this feature to hide a backdoor in the code that will not be spotted by a human reviewer as
it is not visible.</p>
<p>This can lead to supply chain attacks since the backdoored code might persist over a long time without being detected and can even be included in
other projects, for example in the case of libraries.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> This text requires a right-to-left writing system (to use Arabic or Hebrew words, for example). </li>
  <li> The author of this text is a legitimate user. </li>
  <li> This text contains a standard instruction, comment or sequence of characters. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered no to any of these questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Open the file in an editor that reveals non-ASCII characters and remove all BIDI control characters that are not intended.</p>
<p>If hidden characters are illegitimate, this issue could indicate a potential ongoing attack on the code. Therefore, it would be best to warn your
organization’s security team about this issue.</p>
<p>Required opening BIDI characters should be explicitly closed with the PDI character.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>A hidden BIDI character is present in front of <code>return</code>:</p>
<pre>
def subtract_funds(account: str, amount: int):
    ''' Subtract funds from bank account then ⁧''' ;return
    bank[account] -= amount
    return
</pre>
<p>The executed code looks like the following:</p>
<pre>
def subtract_funds(account: str, amount: int):
    ''' Subtract funds from bank account then &lt;RLI&gt;''' ;return
    bank[account] -= amount
    return
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>No hidden BIDI characters are present:</p>
<pre>
def subtract_funds(account: str, amount: int):
    ''' Subtract funds from bank account then return; '''
    bank[account] -= amount
    return
</pre>
